        <p><b>OR.</b><br> Say, dames and damsels, have we heard aright,
            And speed we to the goal of our desire?</p>
            <p><b>CH</b><br>And what desire or quest hath brought thee hither?</p>
            <p><b>OR.</b><br>I seek Aegisthus’ dwelling all this while.</p>
            <p><b>CH.</b><br>Welcome. The tongue that told thee hath no blame.</p>
            <p><b>OR.</b><br> Which of you all will signify within
                Our joint arrival,—not unwelcome here.</p>
             <p><b>CH.</b><br>This maiden, if the nearest should report.</p> 
            <p><b>OR.</b><br>Mistress, wilt thou go yonder and make known,
                That certain Phocians on Aegisthus wait?</p> 
                <p><b>EL.</b><br> Oh! can it be that you are come to bring
                    Clear proofs of the sad rumour we have heard?</p>
                <p><b>OR.</b><br>I know not what ye have heard. Old Strophius
                    Charged me with tidings of Orestes’ fate.</p>
                    <p>What, stranger? How this terror steals on me!</p> 
                    <p><b>OR.</b><br>Bearing scant remnants of his body dead
                        In this small vase thou seest, we bring them home.</p>
                        <p><b>EL.</b><br>O sorrow! thou art here: I see full well
                            That burden of my heart in present view.</p> 
                            <p><b>OR.</b><br>If thou hast tears for aught Orestes suffered,
                                Know that he lies within this vessel’s room.</p>
                                <p><b>EL.</b><br> Ah, sir! by all in Heaven, if yonder urn
                                    Hide him, ah! give it once into my hand,
                                    That o’er that dust I may lament and mourn
                                    Myself and mine own house and all our woe!</p>
                                    <p><b>OR.</b><br>Bring it and give her, whosoe’er she be.
                                        For not an enemy—this petition shows it—
                                        But of his friends or kindred, is this maid</p>
                                        <p class = "stage-direction">[The urn is given into ELECTRA’S hands]</p>
                                        <p><b>EL.</b> O mponument of him whom o’er all else
                                        I loved! sole relic of Orestes’ life,
                                        How cold in this thy welcome is the hope
                                        Wherein I decked thee as I sent thee forth!
                                        Then bright was thy departure, whom I now
                                        Bear lightly, a mere nothing, in my hands.
                                        Would I had gone from life, ere I dispatched
                                        Thee from my arms that saved thee to a land
                                        Of strangers, stealing thee from death! For then
                                        Thou hadst been quiet on that far off day,
                                        And had thy portion in our father’s tomb
                                        Now thou hast perished in the stranger land
                                        Far from thy sister, lorn and comfortless
                                        And I, O wretchedness! neither have bathed
                                        And laid thee forth, nor from the blazing fire
                                        Collected the sad burden, as was meet
                                        But thou, when foreign hands have tended thee
                                        Com’st a small handful in a narrow shell
                                        Woe for the constant care I spent on thee
                                        Of old all vainly, with sweet toil! For never
                                        Wast thou thy mother’s darling, nay, but mine,
                                        And I of all the household most thy nurse,
                                        While ‘sister, sister,’ was thy voice to me
                                        But now all this is vanished in one day,
                                        Dying in thy death.</p>
