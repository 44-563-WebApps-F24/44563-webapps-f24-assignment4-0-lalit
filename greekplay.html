    <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter ORESTES and PYLADES with the urn._]</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>Say, dames and damsels, have we heard aright, and speed we to the goal of our desire?</p>

    <h3 class="name ch">CH.</h3>
    <p>And what desire or quest hath brought thee hither?</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>I seek Aegisthus’ dwelling all this while.</p>

    <h3 class="name ch">CH.</h3>
    <p>Welcome. The tongue that told thee hath no blame.</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>Which of you all will signify within our joint arrival,—not unwelcome here.</p>

    <h3 class="name ch">CH.</h3>
    <p>This maiden, if the nearest should report.</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>Mistress, wilt thou go yonder and make known, that certain Phocians on Aegisthus wait?</p>

    <h3 class="name el">EL.</h3>
    <p>Oh! can it be that you are come to bring clear proofs of the sad rumour we have heard?</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>I know not what ye have heard. Old Strophius charged me with tidings of Orestes’ fate.</p>

    <h3 class="name el">EL.</h3>
    <p>What, stranger? How this terror steals on me!</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>Bearing scant remnants of his body dead in this small vase thou seest, we bring them home.</p>

    <h3 class="name el">EL.</h3>
    <p>O sorrow! thou art here: I see full well that burden of my heart in present view.</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>If thou hast tears for aught Orestes suffered, know that he lies within this vessel’s room.</p>

    <h3 class="name el">EL.</h3>
    <p>Ah, sir! by all in Heaven, if yonder urn hide him, ah! give it once into my hand, that o’er that dust I may lament and mourn myself and mine own house and all our woe!</p>

    <h3 class="name or">OR.</h3>
    <p>Bring it and give her, whosoe’er she be. For not an enemy—this petition shows it—But of his friends or kindred, is this maid.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[_The urn is given into ELECTRA’S hands_]</p>

    <h3 class="name el">EL.</h3>
    <p>O monument of him whom o’er all else I loved! sole relic of Orestes’ life, how cold in this thy welcome is the hope wherein I decked thee as I sent thee forth!</p>

    <p>I bear lightly, a mere nothing, in my hands. Would I had gone from life, ere I dispatched thee from my arms that saved thee to a land of strangers, stealing thee from death!</p>
    
    <p>For then thou hadst been quiet on that far off day, and had thy portion in our father’s tomb. Now thou hast perished in the stranger land, far from thy sister, lorn and comfortless.</p>
    
    <p>And I, O wretchedness! neither have bathed and laid thee forth, nor from the blazing fire collected the sad burden, as was meet.</p>

    <p>But thou, when foreign hands have tended thee, com’st a small handful in a narrow shell. Woe for the constant care I spent on thee of old all vainly, with sweet toil!</p>

    <p>For never wast thou thy mother’s darling, nay, but mine, and I of all the household most thy nurse, while ‘sister, sister,’ was thy voice to me.</p>

    <p>But now all this is vanished in one day, dying in thy death.</p>
